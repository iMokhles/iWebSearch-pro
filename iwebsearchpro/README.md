##Disclosure
==========

Please note that Shmoopi Anti-Piracy is not infalliable, a seasoned cracker will, unfortunately, be able to disable nearly any protection and detection algorithms. This Library is intended to make that as difficult as possible, and as least invasive to the legitimate user as possible.  We claim no responsibility for damages caused by this library.
